Description: This package processes data collected in the field and exports them 
    to the Southeast Utah Group (SEUG) Long-term Vegetation Monitoring Program 
    (LTVMP) database. This package imports Excel workbook files into R, 
    restructures the data, then exports them to the database. The 
    [raindancer package](https://github.com/scoyoc/raindancer) is 
    used to import data from the Onset data loggers into R and summarize them; 
    this package then exports the processed data to the database.
