Description: This package standardizes raw data collected in the field and 
    uploads them to the LTVMP database. Plant and ground cover data are 
    collected in the field using paper datasheets, then transcribed into Excel 
    workbooks. Onset data loggers collect temperature, relative humidity, and 
    precipitation data. These data are exported to comma delimited files 
    (*.csv) using the HOBOware application from Onset. This package imports 
    those workbooks and *.csv files into R, than standardizes the data before 
    importing them into the database.
